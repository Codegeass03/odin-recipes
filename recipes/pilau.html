        <strong>Kenyan pilau rice is a simple dish of rice flavoured with meat stock and spices and sometimes cooked with vegetables. <br>
            This aromatic rice dish is commonly served at parties and occasions, usually with kachumbari (tomato & cucumber salad). <br>
            Similar to jollof rice in West Africa, it is always present on Eid, Christmas and other special occasions. <br>
            Kenyan pilau rice is also known as Swahili pilau rice and East African pilau rice.</strong>

        <li>BEEF</li>
        <li>ONION</li>
        <li>GINGER AND GARLIC</li>
        <li>BAY LEAVES</li>
        <li>SALT</li>
        <li>OIL</li>

    </ul>
    <strong><h3>STEPS</h3></strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the onions and garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>Wash the beef and add into a pan. Slice in one onion and 2 garlic cloves with the ginger. </li>
        <li> Add bay leaves, with a cup of water and some salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Cook until the beef is tender, then remove from heat. Keep the meet chunks and stock to one side.</li>
        <li>In another pan, heat the oil under low heat. Add the onions into the pot and cook until the onions start to caramelize and become brown.<br>
            You should stir the onions with a wooden spoon continuously to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Pour in the garlic and the ground spices. The brownish colour comes from the brown spices. Stir for 30 secs</li>
        <li>Add the rice into the pot. Pour in the stock and meat chunks. <br>
            Add more water so there is enough to cook the rice (read the rice pack instructions). <br>
            Taste for salt and add more if needed.
        </li>
        <li>Cover the rice to cook until all the moisture is absorbed. </li>
    </ol>
